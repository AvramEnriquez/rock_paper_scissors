# rock_paper_scissors
 Play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

Partially created with the help of Kylie Ying's rock, paper, scissors tutorial found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=1274s

This is my second code published publicly to GitHub. I hope giving credit in the readme file is enough.
