# rock_paper_scissors
 Play a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.

Partially created with the help of Kylie Ying's rock, paper, scissors tutorial found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=1274s

Personal implementations:
- getpass module/function to hide input
- Equaling Rock/Paper/Scissors with 1/2/3 to better hide input from others
- Cleanup for tidier output
